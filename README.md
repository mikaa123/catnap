# Catnap

> Catnap helps you REST.

Catnap lets you create REST Resources on middleware-based routers, such as Express'. It simplifies **defining representations** and actions, while keeping your code DRY. Catnap is minimalist and doesn't get in your way by imposing an architecture. It can be dropped as-is on existing Express projects.
