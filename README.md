# Catnap

> a catnap helps you get Express REST.

Catnap is a minimal approach to handle REST Resources on Express-like routers. It simplifies creating named resources and **defining their representations**, while keeping your code DRY. Catnap doesn't get in your way by imposing an architecture. It can be dropped as-is on existing Express projects.
